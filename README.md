## Installation

Open a new R session, and run the following code:

```
install_github("naileakim/marketeR")
library("marketeR")
```

Note: If you get the error `Error: could not find function "install_github"`, you might need to install / load the package `devtools` first:

```
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
```

## Authentification

### Getting your Google Analytics API credentials

The marketeR package is using the [Google Analytics Reporting API V4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/) to get the data you need, and require you to be authentified with an access token. To start using marketeR, please follow the instructions below:

- Login with your Google Analytics account
- Go to [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project).
- Click on `Select a project`, then on `Create project`.
- Click on the `API Manager` tab in the sidebar, search for `Analytics Reporting API V4`. After clicking on it, click on `Enable`.
- Click on the `Credentials` tab in the sidebar,  then on `Create credentials`, select  the `Oauth 2.0 client ID` option, check the `Other` box, give a `Name` and click on `Create`.
- You should now be able to get your `Client ID` and `Client secret`.

### Accessing the Google Analytics API from R

Open a new R session, and run the following code with your credentials:

```
client.id <- "PASTE HERE YOUR CLIENT ID"
client.secret <- "PASTE HERE YOUR CLIENT SECRET"
```

Create your token object, then validate it:

```
token <- Auth(client.id, client.secret)
ValidateToken(token)
```

You can also save your token for future sessions:

```
save(token, file="./token_file")
```

So that in future sessions, you don't need to create a new token, you can just load it:

```
load("./token_file")
ValidateToken(token)
```
